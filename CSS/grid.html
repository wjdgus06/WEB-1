			<div>Computer programming is the process of performing 
				a particular computation (or more generally, 
				accomplishing a specific computing result), 
				usually by designing and building an executable 
				computer program. Programming involves tasks such as 
				analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' 
				accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation 
				of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, 
				commonly referred to as coding)
